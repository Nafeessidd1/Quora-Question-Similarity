# Quora Question Similarity Predictor

This is a Flask web application that predicts the similarity between pairs of questions, specifically designed for Quora questions. The application utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to determine if two questions have the same meaning.

## Features

- **User Interface:** Simple and intuitive web interface for inputting question pairs.
- **Model:** Uses a pre-trained NLP model to predict the similarity.
- **Visualization:** Displays the similarity score and whether the questions are similar or not.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Nafeessidd1/Quora-Question-Similarity.git
   cd Quora-Question-Similarity
Create and activate a virtual environment:

sh
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the pre-trained model:

Ensure you have the necessary model file. If it's hosted somewhere, provide the download link and instructions to place it in the appropriate directory.
Usage
Run the Flask application:

sh
Copy code
flask run
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Navigate to the application in your web browser:

Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
Input the pairs of questions you want to check for similarity.
